# Lab 01 - Elementary Programming I

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this lab is to:
1. Familiarize students with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
2. Use the IDE to solve four short programming exercises

## 2. Lab Learning Outcomes (LLO)
By completing this lab, students should be able to:
1. Use an IDE like NetBeans to edit, compile, debug, and execute a Java program
2. Write simple Java programs
3. Know the difference between `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` commands
4. Know how to use `\n` and `\t` in print (output) statements
